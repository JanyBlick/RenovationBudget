## üéØ Project Overview

Private Renovation Budget is a revolutionary blockchain application that enables homeowners and contractors to confidentially calculate renovation costs while maintaining complete privacy of sensitive financial data. Built on cutting-edge Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, this platform ensures that all budget calculations, contractor bids, and project details remain encrypted throughout the entire process.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in Smart Contracts

**What is FHE?**
Fully Homomorphic Encryption allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:
- ‚úÖ All renovation costs remain private during calculation
- ‚úÖ Contractor bids are encrypted and cannot be viewed by competitors
- ‚úÖ Homeowner budgets stay confidential throughout the bidding process
- ‚úÖ Mathematical operations (addition, multiplication) work seamlessly on encrypted values

### Private Renovation Budget Calculation

The platform revolutionizes traditional renovation estimation by:

1. **Encrypted Input Processing**: Room dimensions, material preferences, and budget constraints are encrypted before blockchain submission
2. **Confidential Computation**: Smart contracts perform cost calculations on encrypted data using FHE operations
3. **Private Bid Comparison**: Contractors submit encrypted bids that can be compared without revealing actual amounts
4. **Secure Budget Estimation**: Final budget estimates are generated while maintaining complete privacy of all input parameters

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works

### For Homeowners
- **Create Projects**: Define renovation requirements with encrypted room specifications
- **Add Requirements**: Specify room types, sizes, and renovation needs confidentially
- **Calculate Budgets**: Get accurate cost estimates without revealing sensitive financial information
- **Review Bids**: Compare contractor proposals while maintaining bid confidentiality
- **Select Contractors**: Approve projects and choose contractors based on encrypted evaluations

### For Contractors
- **Submit Encrypted Bids**: Provide competitive quotes without competitors seeing your pricing
- **Access Project Details**: View homeowner requirements while respecting privacy boundaries
- **Maintain Competitiveness**: Bid confidentially on multiple projects simultaneously

### For Administrators
- **Verify Contractors**: Manage contractor credentials and platform access
- **Oversee Operations**: Monitor platform usage while respecting user privacy
